# SushiRoad 🍣

A web-based reservation and wait-time monitoring tool for **Sushiro Taiwan (壽司郎)**, reverse-engineered from the official mobile app's API.

## Features

- **Store Browser** — Browse all 56 Taiwan Sushiro locations with real-time queue status, geolocation-based distance sorting (auto-saved), and search
- **Smart Reservation** — Input your desired dining time; the system checks for available slots within ±15 minutes and lets you pick, or falls back to monitoring mode
- **Wait-Time Monitoring** — When no reservation slot is available, monitors the store's queue in real-time and sends a push notification via [ntfy.sh](https://ntfy.sh) when it's the optimal time to take a ticket in the app
- **Configurable Timing** — Set how many minutes early or late you're willing to arrive
- **Auto-Setup** — ntfy topic auto-generated from your email on login; geolocation persisted across sessions

## How It Works

```
User selects store + time (e.g. 14:30)

                      ▼

                 ┌────┴────┐

                 │         │
                 ▼         ▼
           "No queue,  "Go take a
            go eat!"    ticket now!"
                 │         │
                 └────┬────┘
                      ▼
               ntfy.sh push
               notification
```

## Reverse Engineering

The Sushiro CRM API was reverse-engineered from the official Flutter/Dart mobile app (`tw.co.akindo_sushiro.sushiroapp`):

- **APK decompilation** via jadx to extract environment configs and API endpoint definitions
- **Authentication format** discovered via mitmproxy traffic capture on a rooted Android device:
  - Login: `POST /remote/login` with `application/x-www-form-urlencoded` body
  - Basic Auth: `email@REGION:password` (not just `email:password`)
  - Region code is uppercase (`TW`)
- **Reservation API**: `POST /remote_auth/newreservation` with Basic Auth + JSON body
- **Check-in code**: Last 4 digits of `ticketId`

### API Endpoints Used

| Endpoint | Auth | Purpose |
|----------|------|---------|
| `GET /info/storelist` | None | List all stores with queue status |
| `GET /info/reservationtimeslots` | None | Available reservation time slots |
| `POST /remote/login` | Body (form) | Authenticate user |
| `POST /remote_auth/newreservation` | Basic Auth | Create reservation |
| `GET /remote_auth/opentickets` | Basic Auth | Check active reservations |
| `POST /remote_auth/cancel` | Basic Auth | Cancel reservation |
| `GET /remote/groupqueues` | None | Queue numbers for a store |

## Tech Stack

- **Backend**: Node.js + Express (port 3737)
- **Frontend**: Vanilla HTML/CSS/JS (mobile-first UI)
- **Push Notifications**: [ntfy.sh](https://ntfy.sh) (JSON API for UTF-8 support)
- **Deployment**: systemd service + Cloudflare Tunnel
- **Platform**: Raspberry Pi 5

## Setup

```bash
npm install
npm start
```

Environment: Node.js 20+. Runs on port 3737 by default (`PORT` env var to override).

### ntfy.sh Setup

1. Install the [ntfy app](https://ntfy.sh) on your phone
2. Login to SushiRoad — a topic is auto-generated from your email
3. Subscribe to that topic in the ntfy app (shown in Settings)
4. You can customize the topic name in Settings

### Cloudflare Tunnel

Add to `/etc/cloudflared/config.yml`:

```yaml
- hostname: sushiroad.your-domain.com
  service: http://localhost:3737
```

## Settings (Browser-Persisted)

| Setting | Default | Description |
|---------|---------|-------------|
| ntfy Topic | `{email-prefix}-sushiroad` | Auto-generated on login, customizable |
| 允許提早 | 10 min | How many minutes early is acceptable |
| 允許遲到 | 5 min | How many minutes late is acceptable |
| 監控間隔 | 60s | How often to check wait times |
| 店鋪刷新 | 60s | How often to refresh store list |
| 地理位置 | Auto-saved | GPS coordinates persisted across sessions |

## Limitations

- **"Go Now" (立即前往)** ticket creation via `/remote/newticket` requires a hidden device registration flow embedded in the Flutter app's compiled Dart code (BoringSSL with stripped symbols). This endpoint cannot be called from outside the app. The web service uses `newreservation` instead.
- Reservations book a specific time slot (earliest usually 60-90 min away), unlike "Go Now" which joins the live queue immediately.
- Cancel from web only — reservations created via web cannot be cancelled from the mobile app (different device GUID).
